# Flappy-Bird
I developed a version of the classic Flappy Bird game using Python and the Pygame library. In this game, the player controls a bird that must navigate through an endless series of gaps between pipes. The bird automatically falls, and the player needs to tap a key to make the bird "flap" and rise, avoiding obstacles to keep the game going.

Key Features:

Simple Controls: Players use a single key to control the bird's flapping motion, making it intuitive and easy to play.

Procedural Pipe Generation: Pipes are procedurally generated with random gap positions to create a unique challenge every time.

Score Tracking: The game tracks the player's score based on the number of pipes successfully navigated, motivating players to beat their high score.

Endless Gameplay: The game loops infinitely, providing a casual and engaging experience with increasing difficulty.
